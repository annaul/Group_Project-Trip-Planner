#SUMMARY

Problem:  People of all demographics have different reasons and requirements for travel destinations.  Information about travel destinations is scattered across multiple sites.

Solution: Our objective is to create an application that surveys travelers to assess their travel parameters. Based on this information, they are provided with a list of destinations that would be a good fit.  Each result will provide valuable details about a destination.
