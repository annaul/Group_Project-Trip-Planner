Gary and his boyfriend Larry are looking for a gay-friendly destination.  They want good food, culture, and warm weather.  Larry has pale Irish skin and burns easily in the sun.  He prefers not to spend his time on the beach.  He opts for museums and shopping, whereas Gary likes to swim and sunbathe.  They want a laid-back vacation where they can each do what they want and reconvene in the evenings.

Amanda and Allen are celebrating their 20th wedding anniversary this June.  They know they want to go somewhere quiet, romantic, and away from families with children.  Their budget is low as they are currently saving up to send their oldest to college next year.  They’ve got 6-9 days off work and under $5000 budgeted for the trip.

Betty and Bob are a retired couple looking to explore some place exotic from November through February.  They are “snowbirds” who typically spend winters in Arizona.  They can’t walk very far but they want an adventure.   Bob is really into photography, so a scenic place would be a bonus.  Betty likes languages, so a non-English speaking country would interest her.

Kate, Bridget, and Gretta are college students looking for a fun place to spend Spring Break.  They like the beach, clubbing, shopping, and adventure activities.  They also hope to meet other twenty-somethings (especially boys).  They have a moderate budget and a week off of school.
